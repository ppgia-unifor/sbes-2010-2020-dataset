# SBES 2010-2020 dataset and complimentary material

This repository contains the [language and citation dataset](dataset.md) for the papers published in the Research Track of the Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES) from 2010 to 2020. The repository also includes complimentary material related to this dataset, such as several lists containing the [most cited SBES papers](top-papers.md) from that period, ranked based on multiple criteria. 

These dataset and complementary material were created as part of the study described in the paper [A Decade of Internationalization of the Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly](SBES_2022_final.pdf), accepted in the Research Track of SBES 2022.
